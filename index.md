### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I love playing Blackjack online.
    I enjoyed learning how to code for a game love so much and learning how
    the computer uses functions in order to make sure the game works

  
* Lab 5
  
  Lab 5, part 1 was something really cool to learn because of how I was able to connect it to real life, because knowing the width and length of something as simple as a rectangle is important for making things in the world, like building houses so having a program that can make the process so much more simple is very helpful to all of us
