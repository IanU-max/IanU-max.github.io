### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I love playing Blackjack online.
    I enjoyed learning how to code for a game love so much and learning how
    the computer uses functions in order to make sure the game works. The way the computer is able tell if there is already an ace or what to call a bust or when the dealer needs to hit. 

  
* Lab 5
  
  Lab 5, part 1 was something really cool to learn because of how I was able to connect it to real life, because knowing the width and length of something as simple as a rectangle is important for making things in the world, like building houses so having a program that can make the process so much more simple is very helpful to all of us.



* Lab 2
  I enjoyed Lab 2 since as a kids I remmeber the fill in the blank books that told funny stories and I really enjoyed them, being able to make one through code was very cool. Using strings was also very nice since it allows us to talk to the user easily which is one of the most important parts of coding in order to get the correct information from the user.
